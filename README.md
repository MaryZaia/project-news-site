# News Site 

The aim of this project was to build a responsive news site using grid, flexbox and media queries. 

As this is my very first project, I mainly focused on understanding the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. That is for example how to use different sectioning tags and classes in HTML and positioning items with the help of grid and flexbox in CSS. 

My biggest challenge was due to starting with the layout for desktop. This made the project more complicated as I really struggled with the responsiveness. The large amount of code in media queries made the project messy and I no longer knew what I had written and why. I restarted the whole project once I no longer could understand my own code. This time I started with the layout for mobile and made sure to write as clean as possible as well as I tried to avoid fixed measurements, so I did not have to overwrite everything in media queries.
